The Watch Project:
This is an Embedded System Project combining a digital watch displayed on an LCD and a temperature sensor that both will be shown on the LCD and then controlled by a Mobile App via WiFi.
This system will control 3 devices (fan, heater, water system) which are simulated with 3 LEDs.
We can control these LEDs with App via WiFi.
